      With a strong foundation in management, law, and taxation, I have pursued a diverse educational journey that includes a Bachelors of Science, a Juris Doctorate, and an LLM in Taxation. Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by completing a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, which enables me to combine legal counsel, business management, product development, and risk mitigation with hands-on programming and systems integration. My goal is to leverage this multidisciplinary expertise to solve complex business challenges, ensuring success through strategic legal counseling and business acumen.

      In my current role as Interim Associate General Counsel at an autonomous vehicle company, I partner with cross-functional teams to manage business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) transactions, ensuring that every deal drives meaningful impact. I draft and negotiate intricate agreements, including NDAs, sales agreements, supply contracts, direct and indirect procurement agreements, and data privacy agreements. I also lead efforts to navigate regulatory compliance and government bidding processes. I pride myself on my collaborative nature and ability to build productive work relationships that contribute to company success.

      My previous experience as General Counsel at an innovative audio, video, and digital signal processing technology company gave me the opportunity to work closely with engineering, product development, and executive teams. I was integral in addressing legal challenges throughout the product lifecycle, helping to mitigate risk and drive forward-thinking strategies that fostered innovation. By bringing together technical insights and legal expertise, I ensured the seamless launch of cutting-edge products, from amplifiers to digital processing systems.

      Outside of work, I’m deeply committed to sustainability. I maintain a home garden, a composting worm bin, and an indoor composting machine to minimize organic waste and reduce my environmental footprint. I also enjoy cooking with low glycemic index ingredients, promoting both health and well-being. Physical activity is a big part of my life, and I stay grounded through cycling and challenging CrossFit bootcamp sessions. Balancing my professional and personal worlds, I find great joy in spending time with my two kids and ensuring that my life remains dynamic, mindful, and full of purpose.
